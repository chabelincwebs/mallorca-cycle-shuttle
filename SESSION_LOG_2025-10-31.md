## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Webhook Before JSON Parser**
   - Stripe webhook route registered BEFORE express.json()
   - Uses express.raw() for signature verification
   - Critical for security

2. **Transaction-Safe Booking**
   - Booking creation + payment intent in try-catch
   - Automatic cancellation if payment fails
   - Seats restored on failure

3. **Admin Refund Management**
   - Manual refund capability for customer service
   - Automatic seat restoration
   - Tracks refund amounts in database
