## Bus out, bike back in Mallorca
### How to discover more of the island

## Our impressions of Mallorca Cycle Shuttle

We first used the excellent <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">Mallorca Cycle Shuttle</a> in 2016. Since then we've gone back in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024 and again in 2025. Every trip, they handled our airport pick-ups and drop-offs smoothly, and every driver was welcoming and friendly.

We regularly take the <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">scheduled bike bus</a> to <a href="/en/bike-shuttle/andratx-pollenca-guide/" target="_blank">Andratx</a> from our hotel in Port de Pollença and this return ride is always the highlight of the trip.

## Why we use the bike bus

We've cycled in Mallorca for years, but taking a one-way <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">bike bus</a> opened up new roads, climbs and villages like Andratx, Estellencs and Banyalbufar. My comfortable daily limit is around 70 miles (about 110 km). Doing that distance in a straight line from A to B instead of a loop was a game-changer.

If, like me, you come to Mallorca to ride, you might hesitate to get on a bus instead of staying on two wheels. Don't. You'll reach stunning parts of the island that are otherwise a stretch to include in a packed week. Thanks to the shuttle we finally ticked off climbs and routes that kept eluding us on earlier trips.

## Highlights and plans

The <a href="/en/bike-shuttle/andratx-pollenca-guide/" target="_blank">Andratx to Port de Pollença</a> ride is the standout of our trips and remains a must-do for us. Next up for us in 2026: "The Big Daddy" challenge taking in Port des Canonge, Port de Valldemossa and Sa Calobra.

**Booking tip:** popular Andratx days can sell out weeks ahead. Book early in your stay so your legs are fresh and you've got weather wiggle room. If the forecast turns, <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">Mallorca Cycle Shuttle</a> have been quick to reschedule or refund.

## How they looked after our bikes

We bring our own bikes, so care in transit mattered. No issues at all. Bikes were packed between mattresses and strapped securely. They arrived unmarked and ready to ride.

## Why we now add optional bike rescue cover

Back in 2016 two riders in our group touched wheels, leading to a low-speed tumble. No ambulance was needed, but one rider didn't want to continue and the other had a badly out-of-true rear wheel. They waited over four hours roadside before a €115 taxi finally arrived. Lesson learned. Since then we have added <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Rescue-&-Recovery-c15728236" target="_blank">Mallorca Bicycle Rescue</a> for peace of mind. If the body or bike fails, you're not wasting half a day sorting transport.

## Here's to a brilliant 2026!
