## About Us and our story

We currently transport approximately 30,000 cyclists a year in Mallorca via:

- Scheduled bike bus shuttles to the start of the best one way routes.
- Private bike bus shuttles (bike out/bus back or bus out/bike back).
- We perform hundreds of rescues (when bike or body breaks down).
- Airport transfers, where we help ease what can be the most stressful part of any visit.

We had the idea of running scheduled shuttles to allow adventurous cyclists to explore more of Mallorca, so in 2015, we started with a custom bike trailer and enthusiasm! After a brilliant journey we have arrived to the present day having helped over 350,000 cyclists make more of their limited time in Mallorca.

We still have smiles on our faces and an unwavering desire to continue improving and helping visiting cyclists make the most of their visit.

## What's New for 2026

Our latest additions for 2026 are new scheduled services, an office at the airport, an improved and expanded private shuttle booking system and we are now the proud owners of the only taxi licences in Escorca which is a beautiful and remote (and the largest and least populated!) municipality nestled in the heart of the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range in northwest Mallorca, characterised by a dramatic, monumental landscape of high peaks, rugged cliffs, and isolated coves. It is an essential destination for nature lovers, hikers, and cyclists.

We look forward to either seeing you again or meeting you for the first time.

**Happy Cycling!**
