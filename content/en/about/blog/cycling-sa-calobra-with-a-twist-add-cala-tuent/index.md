You've ridden Sa Calobra before. You've flown down those hairpins, glanced at that left-hand turn about four-fifths of the way down, and wondered where it leads. Short answer: to a quieter, stunning out-and-back that makes Sa Calobra even better. Here's how to fold Cala Tuent into your day without wrecking the flow.

## Why add Cala Tuent?

- Extra views, zero crowds, proper adventure vibes.
- Smooth hairpins down to a turquoise bay, then a satisfying climb back.
- An easy way to turn a great ride into a memorable one.
- The add-on: ~10.5 km total with +334 m climbing. Out and back. Worth it.

## The route at a glance

1. Descend Sa Calobra from Coll dels Reis to the Port as usual.
2. Skip the port stop and turn back uphill.
3. After roughly 2 km of gentle climbing, take the signed turn for Cala Tuent / Es Vergeret on your right.
4. You'll meet a 7% ramp for about 1 km straight away. Don't panic. Settle in.
5. Continue through peaceful, near-empty roads to the Ermita de Sant Llorenç and Mirador. Views of Cala Tuent will hit you here.
6. Enjoy the scenic hairpins down to the bay.
7. Return the same way to the Sa Calobra road, then rejoin the main climb to Coll dels Reis.

## What it feels like

Expect a brief sting in the legs leaving the main road, then calm, quiet mountain riding. No buses. Few cars. Often no other cyclists. The descent to the bay is a joy; the climb back rewards steady pacing. Rejoining Sa Calobra with the other cyclists who have not been to Cala Tuent may make you feel a little smug.

## Food and water

There's one restaurant at Cala Tuent: Es Vergeret. It's a lovely terrace over the sea. If you want a meal, phone ahead in season. Otherwise, carry snacks and water—there are no shops.

- **Es Vergeret:** Open March to October, closed Mondays. Contact: <a href="https://www.esvergeret.com/en/contact" target="_blank">https://www.esvergeret.com/en/contact</a>
- Quick options: coffee, cake, ice cream.
- Full plates: seafood pasta and similar carb-friendly dishes.

## Distances and elevation

- **Cala Tuent add-on:** ~10.5 km, +334 m.
- **Classic big day from Port de Pollença/Alcúdia/Can Picafort including Cala Tuent:** ~113 km, +2,374 m.
- **Without Cala Tuent:** ~103 km, +2,040 m.
- **Time-saver option (see shuttle below):** Lluc → Sa Calobra via Cala Tuent → back to Port de Pollença ~78 km, +1,583 m.
- **Without Cala Tuent:** ~68 km, +1,249 m.

## Smart ways to include it

- **Full-fat mountain loop:** Up Coll de sa Batalla hairpins, down Coll de Femenia on the way home. Add Cala Tuent between your Sa Calobra descent and final climb.
- **Short on time or want fresher legs?** Use our <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">Sa Calobra Express</a>. We drop at the Repsol in Lluc, so you can focus on the best bits and still add Cala Tuent without blowing the schedule.

We run the <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">Sa Calobra Express</a> with a drop-off at the Repsol Lluc. Ideal if you're limited on time or want to climb with fresh legs or want to use it as a starting point to add more distance (Cala Tuent, up and over Puig Major etc)

## Safety and support

Sa Calobra and its add-ons are hotspots for mechanicals and tired legs. Have a plan.

If bike or body break down, our <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Rescue-&-Recovery-c15728236" target="_blank">Mallorca Bicycle Rescue</a> will collect you and your bike and take you where you need to go. Peace of mind on big mountain days.

## Tips that actually help

- **Pace the add-on.** Keep it aerobic; the main climb is still ahead of you.
- **Gears matter.** Compact or mid-compact with a friendly cassette saves the day.
- **Start earlier.** Beat bus traffic on the main Sa Calobra road and enjoy quieter views.
- **Season notes.** Es Vergeret runs March–October, closed Mondays. Outside those months, bring your own supplies.
- **Photos.** Loads of options for scenic photos and <a href="https://www.mallorcacyclingphotos.com/" target="_blank">Mallorca Bike Fotos</a> are on Sa Calobra in season to capture professional images of you in action.

## Bottom line

Yes, improving your PR on Sa Calobra is fun. But adding Cala Tuent gives you something most riders miss: empty ribbon roads, a gorgeous bay, and a fresh angle on Mallorca's best-known climb. Do it once and you'll wonder why you waited.

Ride it this year. You won't be disappointed.
