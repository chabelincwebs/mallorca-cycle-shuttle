## Helping cyclists since 2015

2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year for cycling in Mallorca! As we kick off the spring season, we're also celebrating a huge milestone—helping cyclists since 2015.

We couldn't have done it without you, the amazing cycling community. Thank you!

This year, we're doubling down on our mission to help make every ride safe, sustainable, and unforgettable – for both cyclists and locals. For the first time, we're introducing <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">scheduled shuttle services</a> from the South finally! (More details below.)

Whether you're visiting Mallorca for the first time or returning for another amazing season, here's everything you need to know to make the most of your cycling adventure in 2025.

## What's New for Cyclists in 2025?

Mallorca is committed to being one of the safest and most bike-friendly destinations in the world. Here's what's new this year:

### Improved Road Surfaces

The Consell de Mallorca is investing €16 million in resurfacing and safety improvements across the Tramuntana range, including:

- **Sa Calobra:** Resurfacing scheduled for late 2025.
- **Coll de Sóller & Bunyola-Orient-Alaró roads:** Dates TBD but it's looking like late in the year.
- **Andratx to Banyalbufar:** Already underway!

### New Traffic Laws for Cyclists

Already we have some of the safest and best roads in the world, and Spain's new traffic laws aim to keep everyone safer:

- **Mandatory Helmets:** Starting in 2025, helmets must be worn at all times—no exceptions.
- **Lights & Reflective Gear:** Cyclists must use these in low-visibility conditions and at night.
- **Visibility Rule:** Cyclists must be visible from at least 150 meters.

Make sure you're ready and compliant before hitting the road!

### #Respect 2025

Cycling holidays are all about fun and adventure, but remember—Mallorca's roads are shared spaces. Respect and awareness are key to keeping the island a paradise for both cyclists and locals.

**Here's how you can help:**

- **Follow Traffic Rules** – Obey all signs, signals, and speed limits.
- **Stay Aware of Traffic** – Be extra mindful in popular areas.
- **Ride Single File When Needed** – Especially on narrow roads or in low-visibility areas.
- **Respect the Environment** – Don't litter. Keep gel wraps and trash until you find a bin.
- **Avoid Risky Overtakes** – Passing cars on corners or on the right is dangerous—don't do it.

By riding responsibly, we can all ensure that Mallorca remains a world-class cycling destination.

## Cyclists are always welcome

You may have heard about recent "anti-tourist" sentiment in Mallorca. While some protests focus on overcrowding and government policies, we want to make one thing clear:

**Cyclists are very welcome.**

Cycling has been part of Mallorca's history long before mass tourism, and the cycling community continues to respect the island's beauty, culture, and local life. We're proud to support a sport that brings so much positive energy to Mallorca.

**How can you do your bit to give back to the community?** Support local businesses whenever and however you can.
