Short version: you came to ride. Don't waste the trip. Here are the common ways people mess it up – and what to do instead.

Roll at sunrise on big-ticket days (Cap de Formentor, Sa Calobra, MA-10).
Carry photo ID and a phone with WhatsApp.
Respect grippy-but-slippery roads when damp.
Plan A/B days – don't empty the tank on day 1.
Cover up and hydrate. Sunscreen, bottles, electrolytes.
Book shuttles early in season. Have <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Rescue-&-Recovery-c15728236" target="_blank">Mallorca Bicycle Rescue</a> in your pocket.

## 1) Sleeping late
**The mistake:** rolling out after 9 when traffic wakes up.

**Do this instead:** get up earlier and enjoy near-empty roads, soft light, and cooler temps. Sunrise starts are gold for:

- Cap de Formentor – fewer cars, easier photos, less wind.
- Sa Calobra – descend before coach traffic, climb mostly in the shade.
- MA-10 <a href="/en/bike-shuttle/andratx-pollenca-guide/" target="_blank">Andratx to Pollença</a> – longer day, more café / picture stops, less heat.

Pro tip: plenty of restaurants on arrival for breakfast and en route.

## 2) Not carrying photo ID
**The mistake:** leaving ID at the hotel.

**Do this instead:** carry photo ID (passport or national ID). In Spain the law states police can request it, and it speeds up everything if anything goes sideways.

## 3) Treating the tarmac like back home
**The mistake:** braking and cornering as if you're on your home roads.

**Do this instead:** Mallorca's surfaces are smooth and fast but can be slick with morning dew or after the first rain because of the increased percentage of gravel in the tarmac to deal with the summer heat. Brake early, be gentle on paint lines and polished patches, and save the heroics for another time.

## 4) Skipping the best route on the island
**The mistake:** avoiding the MA-10 coast to coast route between <a href="/en/bike-shuttle/andratx-pollenca-guide/" target="_blank">Andratx to Pollença</a> because it looks "too big".

**Do this instead:** pick your flavour – 115 to 167 km with real climbing and café heaven – and make it your marquee ride. It is tough and absolutely brilliant. Get the training in before arrival.

## 5) Ignoring Cap de Formentor
**The mistake:** skipping one of the world's most photogenic lighthouse rides. If you stay in the South, <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">Mallorca Cycle Shuttle</a> can now bring you up to Port de Pollença.

Cars are now banned from going to the lighthouse from the beginning of June to the end October 10am to 10pm.

## 6) Not riding Sa Calobra
**The mistake:** telling yourself you'll "save it for next time".

**Do this instead:** do it right this time. Either ride in and out or take the <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">Sa Calobra Express</a> to hit the climb with fresh legs and chase a PB. Want more? Add Cala Tuent for scenery and more climbing.

## 7) Forgetting bike rescue
**The mistake:** a snapped mech hanger or body breakdown turns into a half-day faff for you and your group.

**Do this instead:** carry a <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Rescue-&-Recovery-c15728236" target="_blank">Mallorca Bicycle Rescue</a> policy. When the bike or your body breaks down, you get picked up and taken either to a bike shop or back to your base – your choice. Coverage runs from sunrise to sunset.

## 8) Skipping sunscreen and hydration
**The mistake:** "I don't burn."

**Do this instead:** sunscreen on face, neck, ears, arms; reapply at long café stops. Two bottles, top up often, add electrolytes. The island gets 308+ sunny days per year – act accordingly.

## 9) Overcooking day one
**The mistake:** full-gas on arrival, limp the rest of the week.

**Do this instead:** alternate big and easy days. Think: opener, marquee, recovery spin, second marquee, easy spin.

## 10) Alcohol amnesia
**The mistake:** gin and tonics like it's a recovery drink.

**Do this instead:** enjoy the terrace, but keep it moderate if tomorrow matters.

## 11) Assuming "cheapest is best"
**The mistake:** bargain-basement prices with champagne expectations.

**Do this instead:** Mallorca has brilliant, sustainable businesses that charge fair prices for proper service. Book those.

## 12) Riding on pavements and walkways
**The mistake:** using pedestrian spaces to shortcut.

**Do this instead:** use the smooth roads. Safer for everyone.

## 13) Forgetting the local lanes
**The mistake:** missing out on over 7 000km of small almost traffic free cami rurals (local roads).

**Do this instead:** go off the beaten path. If you do get 'lost' it's part of the adventure, with 20 minutes more pedalling you will figure out where you are - Mallorca is not the size of Australia!

## 14) Forgetting local respect
**The mistake:** assuming drivers are anti-bike like they are in your home country.

**Do this instead:** many locals ride – and they respect cyclists. Act like an idiot? Get treated like an idiot! Its not rocket science. A little courtesy goes a long way. Buses included.

- Photo ID, payment card, health card/insurance details
