January is one of the quietest months in Mallorca, with cooler temperatures making it ideal for those who prefer mild cycling conditions. While you'll need layers for early morning rides, the lack of summer heat and tourist crowds creates a peaceful experience. The Tramuntana Mountains may see occasional snow at higher elevations. Perfect for winter training camps and experienced cyclists who don't mind cooler weather.

## February

February marks the beginning of Mallorca's cycling season, with slightly warmer temperatures than January. Early almond blossoms paint the countryside in stunning white and pink hues. While still relatively quiet, you'll start seeing more cycling groups on the roads. Ideal for structured training camps and those seeking an early-season escape from northern European winters.

## March

**Average Temperatures:** Min 6°C / Max 17°C
**Daily Sunshine:** 7 hours
**Rainy Days:** 5

Spring arrives in March, bringing longer days and warming temperatures. This is when Mallorca truly comes alive for cycling. The island becomes greener after winter rains, wildflowers bloom across the countryside, and conditions are comfortable for all-day rides. March is popular with cycling clubs and training camps. Book accommodation early as this marks the start of high season for cyclists.

## April

**Average Temperatures:** Min 8°C / Max 19°C
**Daily Sunshine:** 8 hours
**Rainy Days:** 5

April is considered one of the best months for cycling in Mallorca. Temperatures are ideal—warm enough to enjoy but not too hot for climbing. The island is at its most beautiful, with spring flowers in full bloom and lush greenery everywhere. Expect more cyclists on popular routes like Sa Calobra and Cap Formentor. Excellent conditions for tackling challenging climbs without the summer heat.

## May

**Average Temperatures:** Min 11°C / Max 23°C
**Daily Sunshine:** 10 hours
**Rainy Days:** 5

Late spring offers fantastic cycling weather with long, sunny days perfect for extended rides. Temperatures are comfortable for both coastal routes and mountain climbs. The island transitions from green to its characteristic summer golden hues. May is very popular with cyclists, so expect busy roads on weekends and book accommodations well in advance. Excellent month for completing long sportives and gran fondos.

## June

**Average Temperatures:** Min 15°C / Max 27°C
**Daily Sunshine:** 11 hours
**Rainy Days:** 3

Early summer brings warm temperatures ideal for cycling, though it can get hot during midday. Morning and evening rides are perfect, while afternoon climbs in the Tramuntana can be challenging in the heat. The sea is warm enough for post-ride swims. Tourist season begins, bringing more traffic to popular areas. Start rides early to avoid afternoon heat and crowds.

## July

**Average Temperatures:** Min 18°C / Max 30°C
**Daily Sunshine:** 11 hours
**Rainy Days:** 1

July is hot in Mallorca, with temperatures often exceeding 30°C, especially inland. This is the peak tourist season, meaning busier roads and higher accommodation prices. Serious cycling requires early morning starts—many cyclists are on the road by 6-7 AM to avoid the midday heat. Hydration becomes critical. The Tramuntana Mountains offer slightly cooler conditions than coastal areas. Best suited for experienced cyclists comfortable with heat.

## August

**Average Temperatures:** Min 19°C / Max 31°C
**Daily Sunshine:** 10 hours
**Rainy Days:** 2

The hottest month in Mallorca. While many serious cyclists avoid August, early morning rides can still be enjoyable. The island is at its busiest with tourists, so expect significant traffic on main roads. Air-conditioned hotels and refreshing sea dips become essential. If you must cycle in August, prioritize short morning rides and reserve afternoons for relaxation. Consider this month only if you're heat-adapted and comfortable cycling in very warm conditions.

## September

**Average Temperatures:** Min 17°C / Max 28°C
**Daily Sunshine:** 8 hours
**Rainy Days:** 6

September is often called the "second spring" for Mallorca cycling. As summer crowds depart, temperatures become more comfortable for serious riding while remaining warm and pleasant. The sea is at its warmest for post-ride swimming. Many consider September one of the best cycling months—offering summer warmth without extreme heat or peak-season crowds. Excellent for both recreational riders and those pursuing performance goals.

## October

**Average Temperatures:** Min 13°C / Max 23°C
**Daily Sunshine:** 7 hours
**Rainy Days:** 8

Autumn brings cooler temperatures and occasional rain, but October remains an excellent cycling month. Conditions are comfortable for all-day rides and mountain climbs. The island is quieter as tourist season winds down. Be prepared for variable weather—morning layers are advisable, though you'll likely shed them as the day warms up. Perfect for those who prefer moderate temperatures and fewer crowds on the roads.

## November

**Average Temperatures:** Min 8°C / Max 18°C
**Daily Sunshine:** 6 hours
**Rainy Days:** 9

Late autumn sees cooler temperatures and increased rainfall, but many sunny days remain perfect for cycling. The island is much quieter, offering peaceful roads and lower accommodation rates. Proper clothing layers become important for early starts. November appeals to dedicated cyclists seeking off-season training conditions without extreme cold. Be flexible with ride plans as weather can be changeable.

## December

**Average Temperatures:** Min 6°C / Max 15°C
**Daily Sunshine:** 5 hours
**Rainy Days:** 8

Winter arrives in December, bringing cooler temperatures and shorter days. While not as popular as other months, Mallorca still offers better cycling weather than much of northern Europe. The island is quiet, and holiday season brings a festive atmosphere. Perfect for winter training camps and hardy cyclists who appreciate the solitude and don't mind cooler conditions. Excellent for building winter base miles.

## The Tramuntana Mountains Microclimate

The Serra de Tramuntana mountain range, running along Mallorca's northwest coast, creates its own microclimate. Temperatures are typically 3-5°C cooler than coastal areas, winds can be stronger, and weather conditions more changeable. Mountain passes like Sa Calobra and Puig Major require extra preparation—bring additional clothing layers even on warm days. The mountains can create a "rain shadow" effect, where the western slopes receive more precipitation than eastern areas. Always check specific mountain weather forecasts before tackling major climbs, especially in shoulder seasons when conditions can change rapidly. This microclimate is part of what makes Tramuntana cycling so spectacular and challenging.
