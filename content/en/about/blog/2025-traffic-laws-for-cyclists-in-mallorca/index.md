This week, the DGT ("Dirección General de Tráfico") announced new traffic laws for 2025 that affect both car and motorcycle drivers as well as cyclists.

We know that it can be confusing to find out which laws apply to you as a cyclist amid all the information, so to make it easier for you and keep you up-to-date, we have created this article. So, which laws will apply to cyclists in 2025?

For cars, the rule of leaving a 1.5-meter space when overtaking a cyclist remains. What changes this year is that drivers must reduce their speed by 20 km/h below the maximum allowed speed on the road when overtaking a cyclist. In other words, on a road with a maximum speed of 90 km/h, cars must overtake cyclists at a maximum speed of 70 km/h. Failure to comply with this law could result in a fine of 200 euros and 6 points off the driver's license.

Regarding rules that will directly affect cyclists, there is the mandatory use of the helmet. Until now, cyclists were not required to wear helmets in certain situations. Starting in 2025, helmets will be mandatory at all times, with no exceptions.

The rule to use lights and reflective gear in low visibility situations and at night remains. Cyclists must be visible to other road users from a distance of at least 150 meters.

## Other laws and regulations that will remain in effect in 2025:

### Mobile phone use: NO

It is completely prohibited to use a mobile phone while riding a bike. Headphones connected to sound devices are also prohibited. Headphones impair hearing and can cause distractions.

**Using a mobile phone or headphones: 200€**

### No alcohol

Yes, the maximum alcohol limit for drivers in general (0.5 g/l of alcohol in blood or a breath alcohol level higher than 0.25 milligrams per liter) also applies to cyclists. They are also required, like other drivers, to take an alcohol test if requested by an officer.

**Positive alcohol test: 500–1,000€**

### Right of way

Cyclists have priority over motor vehicles when riding on a bike lane, bike crossing, or properly marked shoulder.

### Groups in roundabouts

Cyclists riding in a group have priority—everyone, from the first to the last—at roundabouts, just like at other intersections, when the first cyclist has already entered the roundabout.

### Starting to move

Before starting to move, all cyclists must—just like other drivers—check the road they are entering, ensuring no vehicles are nearby or that they are far enough away that it is safe to start moving, and signal the maneuver.

**Dangerous merging: 200€**

### No riding on the sidewalk

It is prohibited to ride a bike on sidewalks and pedestrian zones unless specifically marked as a shared bike lane with pedestrians.

**Riding on the sidewalk: up to 100€**

### On the right

In the city, bicycles must ride as close to the right side of the road as possible, leaving a safety gap from the curb or parked vehicles. When riding in a group, cyclists may ride two abreast at most.

**Riding in an unordered group in the city: 100€**

### In parallel

Cyclists are allowed to ride in parallel on the road, staying as close as possible to the right side of the road. However, in areas with limited visibility (such as curves) or when there are crowds, they must ride single file.

**Riding in an unordered group on the road: 100€**

## Other tips and rules to follow to improve cyclist safety:

- Always signal if you are going to brake suddenly. The best way is to move your arm up and down to alert other drivers. This is mandatory.
- Whenever possible, ride on the bike lane or shoulder if available.
- Don't ride a bike if you are under the influence of alcohol.
- Do not use your mobile phone or wear headphones while cycling. The risks are the same as if you were driving a car.
- Always obey traffic signals, such as traffic lights. They are mandatory for all road users.
- Always wear a helmet.
- Remember that pedestrians have priority over bikes—respect crosswalks.
- When riding in parallel on the road, keep in mind that the rightmost rider must stay on the shoulder, and it is not allowed in areas with poor visibility or in crowded sections.

We promote responsible use of the road. Remember that following traffic laws and respecting other road users is key to ensuring your own safety and the safety of others around you. We want you to be able to use the roads safely for a long time.
