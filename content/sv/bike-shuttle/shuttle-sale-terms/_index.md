Your agreement to these Mallorca Cycle Shuttle terms and conditions confirms that you understand the ticket you are purchasing.

## Fitness and Skills

By purchasing a shuttle bus ticket, you confirm that you are fit enough and have the skills required to cycle back to your starting point. If you are unsure of your ability to complete the return ride, please choose an easier route or do not purchase a ticket.

## Children

Our shuttle buses are not suitable for young children. Children aged 15 and under must be accompanied by a paying adult.

## Ticket Validity

Your ticket is valid only for the Mallorca Cycle Shuttle service at the time and date stated on the ticket. The ticket remains the property of the company and must be made available for inspection by the driver on request.

## Refunds and Changes

Tickets are non-refundable.

**Flexi tickets:** You are allowed one free date change to a service that suits you better more than 48 hours before travel, provided seats are available on the new service. Additional changes incur an administration charge of €10 per ticket per change.

**Standard tickets:** A change may or may not be possible, depending on availability on the new service. Where a change is possible, an administration charge of €10 per ticket per change will be made.

No changes to any ticket are possible less than 48 hours before travel.

## Boarding and Departure

The shuttle bus cannot wait for latecomers. No refunds will be given to passengers who do not arrive in time for departure. Please arrive at least 5 minutes before your chosen bike-loading time so we can load and secure your bicycle before departure.

## Service Cancellations

We reserve the right to cancel or suspend services as necessary and without prior notice.

If fewer than 6 passengers are booked on a scheduled service, the service may not run. If the service does not run, you may choose either a full refund for tickets purchased or a transfer to an alternative scheduled shuttle, if seats are available.

If we cancel a shuttle for reasons within our control, you may choose either a full refund or a transfer to an alternative scheduled shuttle with available seats.

If we cancel due to inclement weather, you may choose either a full refund or a transfer to an alternative scheduled shuttle with available seats.

If we need to adjust collection times, please monitor your email and telephone for messages from us.

If we cancel a service for reasons outside our control (excluding inclement weather), no refunds will be possible.

## Personal Belongings

We take no responsibility for items left on the bus. Personal items are carried at the owner's risk, and Mallorca Cycle Shuttle cannot accept responsibility for items that are damaged or lost.

## Conduct

Smoking and alcoholic drinks are not permitted on the shuttle bus.

Mallorca Cycle Shuttle reserves the right to refuse entry to vehicles and premises to intoxicated persons. In such cases, tickets will not be refunded.

We will not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour towards staff or other passengers and reserve the right to refuse entry to vehicles and premises. In such cases, tickets will not be refunded.

Please be mindful of other passengers. Anyone behaving in a disruptive manner will be asked to disembark.

## Route Information

The shuttle bus does not stop en route.

As a transport service, we are not responsible for the state of the roads or whether any particular road is open or closed to cyclists. There are many return routes from each of our destinations, and you may need to choose an alternative if your first choice is unavailable. Please check the official road status for Mallorca before you ride.

## Facilities

There are no toilet or water facilities on our vehicles.

## Privacy

Mallorca Cycle Shuttle will not share customer information with third parties, and we do not retain financial information.

## E-Bikes

If you have an e-bike that is larger than a standard road or mountain bike, please tell us at the time of booking so we can ensure there is sufficient space in the trailer.
