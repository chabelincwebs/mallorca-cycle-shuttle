## Discovering my cycling heaven in Mallorca

To say Mallorca is my cycling heaven would be an understatement and since 2013 I have been regularly visiting the north of the island in Puerto Pollença and enjoying the Tramuntana and surrounding area by bicycle.

## Iconic climbs and bucket list ride with Mallorca Cycle Shuttle

Familiar with the iconic climbs and cycles local to that area (Coll de Sa Bataia, Femenia, Sa Calobra, Coll de Sóller and Cap de Formentor) I decided to tick a bucket list cycle off the list and visit more of the mountains by booking myself on the <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">Mallorca Cycle Shuttle</a> to cycle back "home" from <a href="/en/bike-shuttle/andratx-pollenca-guide/" target="_blank">Andratx to Puerto Pollensa</a>. This would allow me to see parts of the Tramuntana by bicycle I'd never been to before while being able to enjoy it to without turning the day into an epic distance wise.

## A Scenic Journey Through the Tramuntana Mountains

At a shade over a 100km (although with plenty of climbs) doing it one way means you can take in the scenery, and there's loads of it, at a comfortable enjoyable pace without having to race the sun.

## Climbing from Andratx: Coll de Gramola and Beyond

So, it was on an April morning I headed to the pick up spot where my bike was safely loaded onto the <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">bike truck</a> and a whole lot of excited cyclists and myself got comfortable on the <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">bus</a> for the trip to the south of the island. The level of excitement from everyone was palpable and everyone got to know each other on the bus which was great as we all passed each other across the course of the day as we took our own speeds and food breaks.

Deposited in beautiful Andratx and an espresso grabbed at one of the many local cafes I headed of up the first climb…and wow what a start up the Coll de Gramola on pristine tarmac with amazing scenery straight of the bat.

## MA-10 Highlights: Deia, Sóller, and the Monnáber Tunnel

The MA10 continued to amaze zig-zagging through the mountains, climbing col after col, hugging jaw dropping cliffs looking into the blue sea, traversing tunnels and passing through beautiful villages and towns like Deia and Sóller.

## Optional Challenge: Sa Calobra or Continue to Lluc

Getting to Soller you actually have 2 options: Climb Coll de Sóller (amazing) and head back through the flatter vineyards or keep going on the MA-10 and tackle the mighty climb to the Monnáber Tunnel which is what I chose to do. It is an epic climb and at times feels like someone keeps building extra hill as you climb for 17km but once through the tunnel an amazing decent awaits to Gorg Blau and on to the cut off for Sa Calobra at the Viaduct (which is an optional add on if you have the legs…I didn't that day.)

## Descending Femenia and Finishing in Puerto Pollença

From there its sweeping road through pine fresh forest to Lluc Monastery or a food/drink stop at the famous garage at the Sa Bataia before heading down the Femenia which may be my favourite descent on the island. Never steep, scenic and just tame enough to "let go."

With a satisfied grin on my face I finished the last few miles on the ever so slight descent straight through Pollença and back into the Port on what was an unforgettable day entirely made possible by booking with <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">Mallorca Cycle Shuttle</a> also safely covered by the <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Rescue-&-Recovery-c15728236" target="_blank">rescue</a> insurance I had with them meaning at no point was I in fear of being stranded.

## Why You Should Cycle the MA-10 Route in Mallorca

The MA-10 is simply an unforgettable cycle and my words or pictures can't do it justice. All I can say is get yourself booked up and experience it for yourself. It isn't the longest or highest cycle but it's the one that will take your breath away.
