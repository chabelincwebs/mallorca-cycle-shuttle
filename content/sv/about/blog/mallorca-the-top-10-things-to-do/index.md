## What not to miss when cycling in Mallorca!

**Cycling in Mallorca? No visit is complete without these**

Mallorca is a cycling paradise, offering an almost endless array of attractive cycling routes that will make you want to explore every corner of the island. To help you make the most of your cycling trip, here are our top 10+ recommendations of things you should not miss. Enjoy!

## 1. The amazing Coast to Coast route.

Ride through the (Unesco World Heritage!) Serra de Tramuntana mountains from either Port d'Andratx to Port de Pollença or Port de Pollença to Port d'Andratx.

Is this the best cycle route in the world? It is certainly the best ride in Mallorca. If I was given only one more ride ever, this would be it. Take the <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">bike bus</a> to either Port d'Andratx or Port de Pollença, and ride back. Choose routes from 115km up to 167km including the longest and highest climb (or descent on the island of Puig Major. Your cycling soul will thank you for this. Fantastic views, excellent surfaces and good cafés are regularly available. Oh, one small other thing - most of the tarmac is butter smooth!

## 2. Sa Calobra to the summit of Coll dels Reis

The world renowned climb up from the port of Sa Calobra. Often regarded as one of the world's best climbs which includes the famous 270 degree switchback. Now with the option of getting the <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">Sa Calobra Express</a> to the start point so you can attempt a PB with fresh legs – a true highlight of cycling in Mallorca.

## 3. Cap Formentor

Stunning coastal and forest scenery, I challenge you to find a better 20km of road anywhere. Take care at the short tunnel, even though it is now lit, there will be hire cars about! Stop off at the Formentor Beach on the way back and take a swim in the clean Mediterranean. An iconic route you cannot miss when cycling in Mallorca. Now this route is available to those cyclists staying in the South of the island, take a scheduled <a href="https://mallorcacycleshuttle.company.site/products/Scheduled-Bike-Buses-c15728235" target="_blank">Mallorca Cycle Shuttle bike bus to Port de Pollença</a>.

## 4. Port Valldemossa climb

A bonkers climb at a length of 7.9km and an average grade of 5.2 %. The road is so narrow in places and many hair pins that you will question why you ever contemplated it, even started it. A third of the way down you will know – it is brilliant, a route like this is reason enough to cycle. Amazing views that lead to an oasis of a Port that is so welcoming it is difficult to leave. The surface is a bit bumpy in places now, but the restaurant is still as good and as reasonable as ever.

This climb is a great addition to your <a href="/en/bike-shuttle/andratx-pollenca-guide/">Coast to Coast epic</a>.

## 5. Port des Canonge climb

Great little descent from the ma-10 at the 80km marker and then a winding 4.9km climb up from a beautiful bay. It is a very scenic detour that will add just under 10 very worthwhile km to your ride. Just off the ma-10 between Banyalbufar and Port Valldemossa this excellent swirling descent down to the 70m wide bay at the bottom is off the beaten path and a joy.

This climb is a great addition to your <a href="/en/bike-shuttle/andratx-pollenca-guide/">Coast to Coast epic</a>.

## 6. The Orient Valley and the Coll de Soller

Begin with 28 hairpins followed by another 26, then cut through a tranquil valley and climb the Coll d'Orient and Coll d'Honor. Stop for lunch at the brilliant Cycling Planet in Alaro and say hello to the owners Laura Brunot and David Muntaner (World Madison Champion). Memory making.

This is a great addition to your <a href="/en/bike-shuttle/andratx-pollenca-guide/">Coast to Coast epic</a>.

## 7. Watch the sun set and the moon rise from Talaia d'Albercutx

Turn up through the car park at the Mirador de Formentor on the way to Cap de Formentor for the couple of extra km up to the 'Pepperpot', the road is not brilliant but fine if you are careful.. Every full moon. Look to the west and as the sun sinks below the mountains, turn to the east and watch the full moon come out of the sea.

If you are not lucky enough to be cycling in Mallorca for this event, take the next best and get up early to watch the sun come out of the sea from either Cap de Formentor or Talaia d'Albercutx . Obviously you will need lights when setting off in the dark!

## 8. The Bay of Pollenca route

Do the full bay when cycling in Mallorca you can't miss climbing up to Cap Formentor as well as to La Victoria and the edge of the military base on the opposite side. You get to see across the bay of Pollença from both sides. 77km with 1700m of climbing. Don't, whatever you do, forget to take pictures.

## 9. Climb the Coll de Sa Battalla and descend the F1 grade surface of Coll de Femenia

Cruise the lanes to Caimari, climb the winding tree lined Col de Sa Bataia, down past Lluc then back towards Pollença, acing those amazing sweeping, swooping cambered corners and trying to not grin for 7km. Obviously take care that your enthusiasm does not surpass your ability

## 10. Almond cake & coffee

Stop at out of the way local (non-tourist) cafés and sample locally made almond cakes with excellent coffee. Repeat as necessary.

## 11. Fresh OJ at the Aqueduct

Stop at the aqueduct on the ma-10 at the Sa Calobra turn off and relax under the trees with a cup of fresh OJ squeezed from locally picked oranges.

## 12. Climb the Puig de Randa

On a clear day (which is most of them), you can see pretty much the whole island from up here. Also called Cura de Randa after the name of the monastery at the top, is the most popular climb in Mallorca not situated in Serra de Tramuntana. It is a place full of history, where Mallorca's first hermitage was built in the 13th century. In fact, while climbing the 7.5km up Puig de Randa, you will find 3 separate hermitages: Santuari de Nostra Senyora de Gracia; Ermita de Sant Honorat; Santuari de Cura.

## 13. Climb San Salvador

Located in the eastern part of Mallorca, the climb up to the San Salvador monastery is 5km with an average of 7%. Starting near Felanitx it snakes its way up to the highest point in Felanitx district, at an altitude of 510 metres. It has spectacular 360 degree views of the whole island on a clear day including views of the Creu de Sant Salvador (cross). The view point has a working water well for topping up your water bottles and the monastery is now a small hotel, restaurant and cafe which is perfect for cake and coffee.
