# Session Summary - October 31, 2025

## 🎯 Major Accomplishment

**Successfully migrated development environment from Windows filesystem to native Linux filesystem and completed Fleet Management API.**

## 🚀 What We Built

### Fleet Management API
Complete CRUD operations for managing shuttle fleet:

**Buses API** (`/api/admin/fleet/buses`):
- Create, Read, Update, Delete bus records
- Fields: name, licensePlate, capacity, bikeCapacity, availabilityType, active
- Prevents deletion if bus is used in scheduled services

**Routes API** (`/api/admin/fleet/routes`):
- Create, Read, Update, Delete route/location records
- Multilingual support (10 languages: EN, DE, ES, FR, CA, IT, NL, SV, NB, DA)
- Location types: pickup, dropoff, both
- Optional GPS coordinates
- Filter by location type

**Sample Data**:
- ✅ 3 buses (Bus A: 8 seats, Bus B: 6 seats, Bus C: 10 seats seasonal)
- ✅ 8 routes (Port de Pollença, Pollença Town, Alcúdia, Can Picafort, Sa Calobra, etc.)

## 📝 Documentation Created

1. **API_REFERENCE.md** - Complete API documentation with request/response examples
2. **TEST_FLEET_API.md** - Testing guide with curl commands and test checklist
3. **QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference for starting development
4. **prisma/seed-fleet.ts** - Sample data seeding script

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: New Working Directory

**Old location**: `/mnt/c/Users/photo/Documents/mallorca-cycle-shuttle/backend`
**New location**: `~/mallorca-cycle-shuttle/backend` (`/home/photo/mallorca-cycle-shuttle/backend`)

**Why we moved**:
- Windows filesystem (`/mnt/c/`) caused persistent permission errors with pnpm/npm
- Native Linux filesystem resolved all installation issues
- Packages installed successfully in 5.7 seconds vs. repeated failures on Windows FS

### Installation Success

```
✅ Packages: +679 dependencies installed
✅ Time: 5.7 seconds
✅ No errors
✅ Prisma Client generated successfully
✅ Server started without issues
```

## 🧪 Testing Status

- ✅ Server running at http://localhost:3001
- ✅ Database connected
- ✅ Health endpoint working
- ✅ Fleet endpoints responding
- ✅ Authentication middleware working (returns 401 without token)
- ✅ Seed data created successfully

## 📂 Project Structure

│   ├── routes/admin/
│   │   ├── auth.ts          (Authentication from VPS work)

```

## 🔄 Next Session Startup

**IMPORTANT**: Always work from the new Linux directory:

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL
sudo service postgresql start

# 2. Navigate to backend (NEW LOCATION!)
cd ~/mallorca-cycle-shuttle/backend

# 3. Start development server
pnpm dev

# Server will start at http://localhost:3001
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Create Admin User** (for testing authenticated endpoints):
   ```bash
   cd ~/mallorca-cycle-shuttle/backend
   npx tsx scripts/create-admin.ts
   ```

2. **Test Fleet API with Authentication**:
   - Login to get JWT token
   - Test all CRUD operations for buses
   - Test all CRUD operations for routes

3. **Build Next API Module** (choose one):
   - Scheduled Services API (create shuttle schedules using buses + routes)
   - Bookings API (customer reservations)
   - Payments API (Stripe integration)

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. ✅ **Windows filesystem permission errors** - Resolved by moving to Linux FS
2. ✅ **pnpm installation failures** - Resolved with native Linux filesystem
3. ✅ **bcrypt native module errors** - Resolved with clean Linux install
4. ✅ **Prisma Client missing** - Generated successfully after move

## 💾 Git Status

- Fleet Management code is ready to commit
- Working directory changed to `~/mallorca-cycle-shuttle/backend`
- .git folder copied to new location

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **WSL2 Performance**: Native Linux filesystem (`~/`) is significantly faster and more reliable than Windows mounted drives (`/mnt/c/`)
2. **Package Installation**: pnpm works flawlessly on Linux FS, struggles on Windows FS
3. **Development Workflow**: All future work should be done in `~/mallorca-cycle-shuttle/backend`

**Session Duration**: ~2 hours
**Lines of Code Added**: ~500+ (Fleet API + seed scripts + docs)
**Status**: ✅ Fully functional Fleet Management API ready for testing
