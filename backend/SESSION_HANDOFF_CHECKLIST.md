## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Minor Issues
- Some TypeScript errors in other files (not blocking, from previous sessions):
  - `src/middleware/customer-auth.ts` - Not all code paths return value
  - `src/routes/admin/bookings.ts` - Several return value warnings
  - `src/routes/customer/portal.ts` - Property 'cancellationReason' type mismatch
- These do not affect the new B2B system functionality

### Configuration Notes
- SendGrid API key shows warning if not starting with "SG." (expected in dev)
- Multiple background bash processes from development (can be safely killed)

## üí° Tips for Next Developer

### Working with B2B Customers
1. CSV format is strict - use validation endpoint first
2. Credit limit checks happen automatically during bulk upload
3. Discounts are applied automatically based on customer settings
4. Soft delete is used for customers with existing data

### Working with Invoices
1. Invoices auto-generate on payment success via webhook
2. Hash chain validates against previous invoice
3. QR codes follow AEAT format specification
4. PDFs are generated on-demand, not stored

### Working with Dashboard
1. Statistics calculate in real-time from database
2. Use date range parameters for custom periods
3. Occupancy rates calculate automatically
4. Revenue breakdowns available by multiple dimensions

### Database Migrations
```bash
# If schema changes are needed:
npx prisma migrate dev --name description_of_change
npx prisma generate
```

### Testing New Endpoints
```bash
# Get JWT token first:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@mallorcacycleshuttle.com","password":"YourPassword"}'

# Use token in requests:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/admin/b2b-customers
```
