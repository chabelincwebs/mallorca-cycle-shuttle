# Scheduled Services API - Summary

## ‚úÖ What We Built

Complete CRUD API for managing scheduled shuttle services.

### Endpoint: `/api/admin/services`

All endpoints require JWT authentication.

## API Endpoints

### 1. List All Services
```http
GET /api/admin/services
```

**Query Parameters:**
- `date` - Filter by specific date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `startDate` - Filter by date range start
- `endDate` - Filter by date range end
- `status` - Filter by status (active/cancelled/completed)
- `busId` - Filter by bus ID

**Response includes:**
- Service details (date, time, prices, capacity)
- Full bus information
- All route details (pickup1, pickup2, dropoff) with multilingual names
- Creator information
- Booking count

### 2. Get Single Service
```http
GET /api/admin/services/:id
```

**Response includes:**
- Everything from list endpoint
- Full list of all bookings for this service
- Cancellation details if cancelled

### 3. Create New Service
```http
POST /api/admin/services
```

**Required fields:**
- `busId` - Must be active bus
- `serviceDate` - Service date
- `departureTime` - Departure time
- `routePickup1Id` - Primary pickup location
- `routeDropoffId` - Dropoff destination
- `priceStandard` - Standard ticket price
- `priceFlexi` - Flexible ticket price

**Optional fields:**
- `routePickup2Id` - Secondary pickup location
- `ivaRate` - Tax rate (default: 0.10 = 10%)
- `bookingCutoffTime` - Booking deadline (default: 16:00)

**Validations:**
- Bus must exist and be active
- Routes must exist and be active
- Pickup routes must have type "pickup" or "both"
- Dropoff route must have type "dropoff" or "both"
- Cannot create duplicate service (same bus, date, time)
- Prices must be > 0
- Automatically sets totalSeats and seatsAvailable from bus capacity

### 4. Update Service
```http
PUT /api/admin/services/:id
```

**Update rules:**
- ‚úÖ Can always update: prices, IVA rate, booking cutoff time, status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If service has bookings:
  - **Cannot** change bus, date, time, or routes
  - Must cancel and create new service instead
- ‚úÖ If no bookings: can update everything

**Why this restriction?**
Customer bookings are linked to specific service details. Changing the bus or route would invalidate existing bookings.

### 5. Cancel/Delete Service
```http
DELETE /api/admin/services/:id
```

**With bookings:**
- Service is marked as "cancelled" (not deleted)
- Cancellation reason recorded
- Returns warning about affected bookings
- Response includes booking count

**Without bookings:**
- Service is permanently deleted

## Business Logic

### Seat Management
- `totalSeats` - Set from bus capacity when service created
- `seatsAvailable` - Decrements when bookings made
- Prevents overbooking automatically

### Pricing
- `priceStandard` - Base ticket price
- `priceFlexi` - Premium ticket with free cancellation/changes
- `ivaRate` - Applied tax rate (10% tourism VAT in Spain)

### Service Status
- `active` - Service is bookable
- `cancelled` - Service cancelled, bookings affected
- `completed` - Service finished (for historical records)

### Booking Cutoff
- Services have a booking deadline (default: 16:00 day before)
- Frontend should enforce this
- Prevents last-minute bookings

## File Structure

```
src/routes/admin/services.ts    - API routes (550+ lines)

## Next Steps

To use the Services API, you'll need:

1. **Create admin user** (if not done):
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/create-admin.ts
   ```

2. **Login to get token**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"your@email.com","password":"yourpassword"}'
   ```

3. **Test services endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/admin/services \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```
