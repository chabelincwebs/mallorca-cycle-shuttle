# Bookings API - Summary

## ‚úÖ What We Built

Complete booking management API with both admin and public endpoints for customers to reserve seats on scheduled shuttle services.

### Endpoints:
- Admin: `/api/admin/bookings` (requires JWT authentication)
- Public: `/api/admin/bookings/public` (no authentication)

## API Endpoints

### ADMIN ENDPOINTS (Authentication Required)

#### 1. List All Bookings
```http
GET /api/admin/bookings
```

**Query Parameters:**
- `serviceId` - Filter by specific service ID
- `status` - Filter by booking status (confirmed/cancelled/completed/no_show)
- `customerEmail` - Search by customer email (case-insensitive)
- `reference` - Search by booking reference
- `startDate` - Filter by service date range start (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `endDate` - Filter by service date range end (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Response includes:**
- Booking details (reference, seats, bikes, pricing)
- Customer information
- Full service details with bus and route information
- Pickup location details
- B2B customer info (if applicable)

#### 2. Get Single Booking by Reference
```http
GET /api/admin/bookings/:reference
```

**Response includes:**
- Everything from list endpoint
- Original booking reference (for changed bookings)
- Changed bookings list (booking history)

#### 3. Update Booking Status
```http
PUT /api/admin/bookings/:reference/status
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "status": "cancelled",
  "notes": "Customer requested cancellation"
}
```

**Valid statuses:**
- `confirmed` - Booking confirmed
- `cancelled` - Booking cancelled (seats restored to service)
- `completed` - Service completed
- `no_show` - Customer didn't show up

**Business Logic:**
- When marking as `cancelled`, seats are automatically restored to the service
- Cancellation timestamp is recorded

### PUBLIC ENDPOINTS (No Authentication)

#### 4. Create New Booking
```http
POST /api/admin/bookings/public/create
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "serviceId": 1,
  "ticketType": "standard",
  "seatsBooked": 2,
  "bikesCount": 2,
  "pickupLocationId": 3,
  "customerName": "John Smith",
  "customerEmail": "john@example.com",
  "customerPhone": "+44 7700 900123",
  "customerLanguage": "en",
  "paymentMethod": "stripe",
  "discountCode": "SUMMER2025"
}
```

**Required fields:**
- `serviceId` - Must be an active service
- `ticketType` - Either "standard" or "flexi"
- `seatsBooked` - Between 1 and 10
- `pickupLocationId` - Must be valid for the service
- `customerName`, `customerEmail`, `customerPhone`

**Optional fields:**
- `bikesCount` - Number of bikes (default: 0)
- `customerLanguage` - ISO language code (default: "en")
- `paymentMethod` - Payment method (default: "stripe")
- `discountCode` - Promotional discount code

**Validations:**
- Service must exist and be active
- Sufficient seats must be available
- Booking cutoff time must not have passed
- Pickup location must be valid for the service
- Ticket type must be "standard" or "flexi"

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Booking created successfully",
  "data": {
    "bookingReference": "MCS-20251031-A7K2",
    "service": { ... },
    "pickupLocation": { ... },
    "seatsBooked": 2,
    "bikesCount": 2,
    "ticketType": "standard",
    "totalAmount": "55.00",
    "paymentStatus": "pending",
    "changeToken": "abc123...",
    "status": "confirmed",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-31T10:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "paymentRequired": true,
  "paymentAmount": 55.00
}
```

**Transaction Safety:**
- Booking creation and seat update happen in a single transaction
- If either fails, both are rolled back

#### 5. Get Booking by Reference (Customer View)
```http
GET /api/admin/bookings/public/:reference
```

**Response includes:**
- Booking reference and status
- Service details (date, time, bus name)
- Route information (multilingual)
- Pickup location (multilingual)
- Customer name and email
- Total amount and payment status
- Change token and remaining changes (for flexi tickets)

**Limited Data:**
- Does not expose sensitive admin fields
- Does not show customer phone number
- Only shows necessary travel information

## Business Logic

### Booking Reference System
- Format: `MCS-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`
- Example: `MCS-20251031-A7K2`
- Uses non-confusing characters (excludes I, O, 0, 1)
- Collision detection with retry logic (up to 10 attempts)

### Ticket Types

**Standard Ticket:**
- Lower price
- No changes or cancellations allowed
- Fixed commitment

**Flexi Ticket:**
- Higher price (typically +‚Ç¨10)
- 1 free change allowed
- Change token provided for security
- Tracked via `changesRemaining` field

### Pricing Calculation
```
Subtotal = pricePerSeat √ó seatsBooked
Discount = Subtotal √ó (discountPercentage / 100)
Base Amount = Subtotal - Discount
IVA Amount = Base Amount √ó ivaRate
Total Amount = Base Amount + IVA Amount
```

**Default IVA Rate:** 10% (Spanish tourism VAT)

### Seat Management
- Seats automatically decremented when booking created
- Seats automatically restored when booking cancelled
- Prevents overbooking (checks seatsAvailable)

### Booking Cutoff
- Services have a booking deadline (default: 16:00 day before)
- Calculated as: service date - 1 day at cutoff time
- API validates cutoff before accepting bookings

### Payment Integration
- Payment status tracked: `pending` | `completed` | `refunded` | `failed`
- Payment method: Currently supports `stripe`
- TODO: Stripe payment intent creation
- TODO: Webhook to update payment status
- TODO: Confirmation email after payment

### Customer Types
- **B2C (Business to Customer)** - Individual travelers
- **B2B (Business to Business)** - Partner companies
- B2B bookings link to `b2bCustomer` table

### Change Tracking (Flexi Tickets)
- `changeToken` - Secure 32-character hex token
- `changesRemaining` - Number of changes allowed (1 for flexi)
- `originalBookingId` - Links to original booking if changed
- `changedBookings[]` - List of all subsequent changes

## Sample Data Created

**4 Bookings seeded:**
- 1 √ó Flexi ticket (John Smith)
- 3 √ó Standard tickets
- Total: 8 seats booked across services
- All bookings status: Confirmed
- All payments: Completed

**Customer Diversity:**
- Multiple languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, IT)
- Various pickup locations
- Mix of bike counts (0-3)

## File Structure

```
src/routes/admin/bookings.ts       - API routes (495 lines)
src/utils/booking-reference.ts     - Reference generators
prisma/seed-bookings.ts             - Sample data generator
src/index.ts                        - Routes registered
```

## Testing

### Public Endpoint (No Auth)
```bash
# Get booking details
curl http://localhost:3001/api/admin/bookings/public/MCS-20251031-SRF4
```

**Response:** ‚úÖ Returns booking with full service and route details

### Admin Endpoint (Requires Auth)
```bash
# List all bookings (without token)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/admin/bookings
```

**Response:** ‚úÖ Returns 401 Unauthorized (correct behavior)

## Integration Points

**Already integrated:**
- ‚úÖ Scheduled Services API - Bookings link to services
- ‚úÖ Fleet Management API - Routes and buses via services
- ‚úÖ Admin Authentication - Admin endpoints protected

**Next to integrate:**
- üí≥ Stripe Payments - Payment processing
- üìß Email Notifications - Confirmation emails
- üîÑ Booking Changes - Change/cancel flexi tickets
- üìä Reporting - Booking analytics
- üéüÔ∏è B2B Portal - Partner booking management

## Key Features

‚úÖ **Dual API Design** - Separate admin and public endpoints
‚úÖ **Transaction Safety** - Atomic booking creation with seat updates
‚úÖ **Smart Validations** - Service availability, cutoff time, capacity checks
‚úÖ **Unique References** - Collision-resistant booking IDs
‚úÖ **Flexi Tickets** - Change token system for modifications
‚úÖ **Multilingual Support** - All route names in 10 languages
‚úÖ **Seat Management** - Automatic increment/decrement
‚úÖ **Payment Tracking** - Payment status and method recording
‚úÖ **Booking History** - Links original and changed bookings
‚úÖ **Customer Privacy** - Limited data exposure on public endpoints

## Security Considerations

- Admin endpoints require JWT authentication
- Public endpoints accessible for customer bookings
- Change tokens use cryptographically random generation
- Booking references exclude confusing characters
- Customer phone numbers not exposed on public GET
- Payment details handled server-side only
