## Session: November 1, 2025 (Evening Session 4) - Service Browser UX Enhancements

**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Lines of Code:** ~19 modified lines
**Focus:** Frontend UX improvements for service browser

### What Was Built

#### 1. Scroll Behavior Improvement
- **Modified:** `static/js/scheduled-booking-form.js` (bookService function, lines 1149-1156)
  - Fixed scroll target when booking from service browser
  - Changed from scrolling to form top (`scheduled-booking-form-container`)
  - Now scrolls to services list section (`services-list`)
  - Added smooth scroll animation with proper timing (500ms wait + 300ms scroll delay)
  - Eliminates need for manual scrolling after service selection
  - Improved user flow: Select service → Auto-scroll to service list → Service highlighted

**Key Features:**
- Smooth scroll animation with `behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center'`
- Proper timing coordination with form pre-population
- Better user experience with automatic positioning

---

#### 2. Service Browser Visibility Control
- **Modified:** `static/js/scheduled-booking-form.js` (updateUI function, lines 1859-1867)
  - Added dynamic show/hide logic for service browser
  - Service browser displays on Step 1 (Select Service) only
  - Automatically hides on:
    - Step 2: Passenger Details
    - Step 3: Payment
    - Step 4: Confirmation
  - Reappears when user clicks "Back" to return to Step 1
  - Cleaner, more focused UI on each booking step

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const serviceBrowser = document.getElementById('service-browser-container');
if (serviceBrowser) {
  if (currentStep === 1) {
    serviceBrowser.style.display = 'block';
  } else {
    serviceBrowser.style.display = 'none';
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Contextual visibility based on booking step
- Eliminates visual clutter during passenger details and payment
- Maintains ability to go back and change service selection
